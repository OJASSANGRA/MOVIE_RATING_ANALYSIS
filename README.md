# MOVIE_RATING_ANALYSIS
This is a data analysis and visualisation project ,where we compare the data of app called fandango 
and we compare the ratings and stars on this app to other movie rating sources.
(which is a movie rating and ticket selling platform)
Here we came on a conclusion that some movie sites that both sell movie tickets and give ratings to the 
movies , have a conflict of interest.And often give fasle or increased ratings to the movies.
